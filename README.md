## Overview
***Collie*** is minimalism software. It's a bundle of lightweight wrappers ontop of common dev-tooling like _git_, _bash_, and various core [_GNU util_]("https://gnu.org") that provide maximum efficiency when it comes to performing routine tasks. _Collie_ ***will never*** require additional dependencies for the user to add to their workflow, opting instead to deliver easier interfaces for performing routine shell operations and or complex bash programming.

_Collie_ ***is in Pre-Alpha*** stage. Which means that not much source code is here to dig into now, but be on the lookout for updates to this repository!
